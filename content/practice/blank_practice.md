In the beginning of your practice, warm up your fingers by playing scales, chords, arpeggios, and the rest of technique of your level.

* **Put a clock on your piano.** Always make sure you divide your time between all the pieces of your program. Start with the most complicated piece, or with the one which I asked you to practice more.

* **Never choose a fast tempo in the beginning,** concentrate on the clarity, texture, and voicing of each musical phrase. Increase the tempo slowly as you improve. Never forget that multiple repetitions of a phrase, and later of the whole piece, is the key to your success.

* **When you work on polyphonic music,** play each voice separately, then try to combine pairs of voices, and later play all the voices together. So much fun!

* **If you use the damper pedal,** make sure you can still hear the original composer's chords and clear melodic line. Some students forget to release the pedal!

* **Understanding of style and specific details** of the pieces you are working on require some knowledge of the time, Ã©poque, and biography. Read some books on music, musicians, and music history - it will help you to understand the music that you are playing.

Listening to classical music CD's may help you, but please ask for my recommendations - listening to a poor performer may do you more harm than good!
