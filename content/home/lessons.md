- description: Individual lessons secessions are designed to achieve progress at each
    student’s personal achievement level. Although student standards and expectations
    are set high, there is no failure. Successful results and further progress is
    best achieved by having goals set a little further than our natural comfort level.

- description: Private lessons are available for students, both beginning and transfers
    from other teachers, of any age or level. Students will receive a weekly one-on-one
    lesson covering of all aspects of a piano/musical education. The lessons will
    include Music Theory, Piano Technique, and Performance Coaching. Although every
    student is different, the standard piano curriculum I teach is based on the proficiency
    levels set by the California Music Teachers Association. Each lesson is adapted
    to each individual student’s needs and musical aptitude.
