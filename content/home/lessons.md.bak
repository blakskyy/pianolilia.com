#### PRIVATE LESSONS            

> Private lessons are available for students, both beginning and transfers from other teachers, of any age or level. Students will receive a weekly one-on-one lesson covering of all aspects of a piano/musical education. The lessons will include Music Theory, Piano Technique, and Performance Coaching. Although every student is different, the standard piano curriculum I teach is based on the proficiency levels set by the California Music Teachers Association. Each lesson is adapted to each individual student’s needs and musical aptitude.

#### INDIVIDUAL SESSIONS         

> Individual lessons secessions are designed to achieve progress at each student’s personal achievement level. Although student standards and expectations are set high, there is no failure. Successful results and further progress is best achieved by having goals set a little further than our natural comfort level.

#### EXCELLENT INSTRUCTION    

> Excellent instruction the primary goal for each student. Piano is the only musical instrument I teach and I do my very best to pass on my knowledge and skills to your child to the best of my ability and patience.
