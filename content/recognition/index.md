      <strong>Below are some of my students who have participated in the MTAC throughout the
      years as a result of their persistent hard work and dedication in reaching this
      high level recognition</strong>

      The Music Teachers&#39; Association of California® (MTAC) sponsors the music
      study program Certificate of Merit® (CM). The program provides a standard of curriculum
      that requires students to strive for focused musical excellence in performance,
      technique, ear training, sight reading/singing, and music theory.

      Initiated in 1933, the annual statewide program involves approximately 30,000 students
      in piano, violin, cello, viola, flute, French horn, oboe, clarinet, saxophone, bassoon,
      baritone/euphonious horn, voice, and harp.

      Only those students who the take the CM exam and who&#39;s test results place them
      in the <strong>top 2%</strong>, are eligible to perform at the annual MTAC convention.
