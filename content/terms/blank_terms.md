## What you can Expect

During your lesson, you will have my full and undivided attention. We will work together at your own pace to unlock your musical potential. I do not deal in sarcasm, put downs, or hidden agendas. I’m serious about my art and hope to instill some of that dedication to my students through my teaching!

## Attendance

Regularity and consistency are important to your piano playing progress.

I expect my students to also be ready and on time. I work on a tight schedule so your allotted lesson time starts and concludes within the specified time you have signed up for regardless if you are not ready. It’s not fair to extend your lesson past your scheduled time slot and keep other students waiting.

## Canceling a Lesson

If If you must cancel your lesson for any reason, I require at least 24 hours notice if a make-up lesson is to be rescheduled. If a 24 hour notice of cancellation is not provided, the tuition for the lesson is forfeited. Students are allowed one make-up lesson per month. If there is more than one absence in a calendar month, make-ups will be arranged if time and space permit, however the teacher is not obligated. All make-ups must be done in the same month as the absence and there are no “make-ups” of “make-ups”. If the student misses the make-up lesson, the tuition for the lesson is forfeited. No refunds will be issued for student’s absences; however, a credit will be issued for a teacher absence.

A two week written notice is required to discontinue lessons and tuition must be paid through this two week period. Although make-up lessons are provided (as stated above), credits or refunds are not given for missed lessons.

I understand that emergencies do happen and try to be understanding. If you have a last-minute emergency that prevents you from coming to your lesson...
you must always notify me by telephone **<span style="color: red;">(562) 234-9142</span>**, not email. **Please DO NOT use e-mail for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">urgent matters</span>.**

Please note that I do not answer my mobile phone during lessons so leave a voice mail message, I will get it upon concluding the lesson.

Acceptable excuses for missing a lesson include:

* Illness
* Genuine emergency
* Car breakdown
* Being abducted by an alien

Unacceptable excuses include scheduling difficulties, conflicting appointments or rehearsals, traffic delays and the like.

## Payment for Missed Lessons

Please note that if you do not give me 24 hours notice, or a reasonable excuse, you are still responsible to pay for lessons that you canceled or missed.

If you are ill..  please do not come to your lesson. For your sake as well as mine. Especially if you have a cold, flu, or other respiratory illness. If you think you are too sick, please phone me right away. We can always reschedule. No lesson, audition, rehearsal, or performance is more important than your own health. and I don’t want to get sick either!

## Practice Regularly

Your lessons are only one element of your learning. Without regular practice, you will not make progress. I will always try to be clear about your realistic goals and give you the assistance for you reach them, but it’s still your responsibility to practice and make that happen. This is where real improvement occurs. Try to dedicate time to practice at least 30 minutes a day!

## My Commitment to You

I promise to work as hard as you do! If you show up with regularity and consistency, if you bring your sense of adventure (and your sense of humor) to the lessons, and if you practice on a regular basis, we will do good work together, you will make progress, and I will truly do everything I can to help you.
